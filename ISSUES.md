## Issues Rules

If you want to open a GitHub Issue, please be sure to follow this policy:

1. It must one of the following issues:
    - bug/performance issue 
    - feature request 
    - build issue 
    - documentation issue (for small doc fixes please send a PR instead)
2. Make sure the Issue Template is filled out.
3. The issue should be related to the repo it is created in.

**Here's why we have this policy:** We want to focus on the work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Individual support should be sought on Stack Overflow or other non-GitHub channels. It helps us to address bugs and feature requests in a timely manner.

We adopted the same guidelines as for the TensorFlow project.
