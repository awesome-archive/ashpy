## How to become a contributor and submit your own code

### Contributing code

If you have improvements to AshPy, send us your pull requests! For those
just getting started, please refer to [this](https://github.com/zurutech/ashpy/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md) pull request template.

AshPy team members will be assigned to review your pull requests. Once the
pull requests are approved and pass all the tests, your pull request will 
be merged into the official codebase.

If you want to contribute, start working through the AshPy codebase,
navigate to the
[Github "issues" tab](https://github.com/zurutech/ashpy/issues) and start
looking through interesting issues. 

### Contribution guidelines and standards

Before sending your pull request for
[review](https://github.com/zurutech/ashpy/pulls),
make sure your changes are consistent with the guidelines and follow the
AshPy coding style.

#### General guidelines and philosophy for contribution

*   Include unit tests when you contribute new features, as they help to a)
    prove that your code works correctly, and b) guard against future breaking
    changes to lower the maintenance cost.
*   Bug fixes also generally require unit tests, because the presence of bugs
    usually indicates insufficient test coverage.
*   When you contribute a new feature to AshPy, the maintenance burden is
    (by default) transferred to the AshPy team. This means that the benefit
    of the contribution must be compared against the cost of maintaining the
    feature.

#### Python coding style

Changes to AshPy Python code should conform to
[Google Python Style Guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md)

Use `pylint` to check your Python changes. To install `pylint`:

```bash
pip install pylint
```

To check a file with `pylint`:

```bash
pylint --rcfile=/tmp/pylintrc myfile.py
```

#### Running tests

In order to run the doctests first you need to install the `pytest-sphinx` package and `pytest-cov` package:

```bash
pip --no-cache-dir install --upgrade git+https://github.com/thisch/pytest-sphinx.git pytest
pip install pytest-cov
```

Then you can run tests with coverage statistics with:

```bash
pytest -x -s -vvv --doctest-modules ashpy --cov=ashpy
```
